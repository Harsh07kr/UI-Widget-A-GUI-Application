# UI-Widget-A-GUI-Application
 The project is developed using Python, leveraging frameworks like Tkinter and potentially other libraries to
create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
• It mimics the look and feel of macOS, complete with system information, application shortcuts, and adjustable
controls for speaker volume and screen brightness.
• The interface dynamically shows hardware and software details such as OS version, machine type, processor,
and RAM capacity.
• This GUI-based project features ten interactive apps, including a Weather App for forecasts, a Clock App for
timekeeping, a Calendar App for scheduling, a File Explorer for managing files, Python IDLE for coding, a Web
Browser for internet access,a Speed Tester for internet speed checks, all designed for an OS-like experience.
• This project likely integrates APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap API for weather updates, to fetch real-time data.
